Overtime, we aim to expand our library. If you have good suggestions, or are after new examples, or would like to provide feedback, please let us know using Issues function. You contributions are very welcome, please feel free to submit a pull request.

## Survey Design Principle

We find a good survey usually starts with a pre-defined, clear scope of which marketing mix the survey is targeting ([marketing mix model](https://archieanugrah.wordpress.com/2012/06/28/5c-4p-basic-case-study-framework/)). Such that the survey's questionnaire design can be logical, precise, comprehensive yet succinct.

Using a common marketing mix model, the target market survey can usually cover the marketing 4C (e.g. customer, competition, collaborator and context) and 2P (e.g. Product and Promotion); The information regarding Place (or target location / dictribution) can be answered later when equipped with additional information from the initial survey and follow up focus groups. The other P - pricing questions will be answered when in-depth pricing design is completed at a later stage.

## Questionnaire Design Tips

A survey designer's ultimate goal will always be maximising amount of quality information retrieved while limiting number of noises. In reality, it is easy to say, but hard to do. We try to ask more questions in case we miss any piece of key information, however, with more questions asked, surveyees' patiences could quickly begin to wear thin which can lead to low quality responses. If you are facing difficulties selecting the right questions for your questionnaire, we suggest you to look into using a control group and a statistical analysis tool to run a pre-survey in order to find out most significant questions before preceed to broadly distribute your questionnaire. Have a look of this online example - it uses decision tree to determine the most significant classification questions to ask: [Example](https://web.fhnw.ch/personenseiten/taoufik.nouri/Data%20Mining/Course/Case%20Study/PA-Tutorial/applied.html). Using the similar technique, you can significantly reduce the number of classification questions without sacrificing much of the survey scope.

If you aggree with our approach yet don't have the resources at your disposal, please contact Sparkseeker, we are happy to organise an suvey on your behalf.

Enjoy!
