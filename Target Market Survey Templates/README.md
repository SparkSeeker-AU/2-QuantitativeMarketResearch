## Survey Design Principles

We found a successful survey usually have a predefined clear scope of which marketing mix elements it targets ([5C/4P marketing mix model](https://archieanugrah.wordpress.com/2012/06/28/5c-4p-basic-case-study-framework/)). That will make help questionnaire design to be logical, precise, comprehensive yet succinct.

Using the 5C 4P model, a target market survey can usually cover the marketing 4C (including customer, competition, collaborator and context) and 2P (including Product and Promotion); The information regarding Place (or target location / dictribution) can be answered later when equipped with additional information from the initial survey and follow up focus groups. The last P - pricing question will be answered when in-depth pricing design is completed.

## Questionair design tips

A survey organisor's ultimate goal will always be maxiumising amount of quality information while limiting number of noises. It is easy to say, but hard to do. We always try to ask more questions in case we miss key information, however, with more questions asked,surveyees' patiences could quickly begin to wear thin. If you are expeiencing the same issue of selecting the right questions for your questionair, we suggest you should look into using a control group and statistical analysis to run a pre-survey in order to find out most significant questions before preceed to broadly distribute your questionair. Have a look of this online sample of using decision tree to determine the most significant behaviour questions to ask if you want to find out who will buy a Range Rover [Example](https://web.fhnw.ch/personenseiten/taoufik.nouri/Data%20Mining/Course/Case%20Study/PA-Tutorial/applied.html). Using the similar technique you can reduce number of questions significantly without sacrificing the quality of information gathered.

If you aggree with our method yet don't have the resources or time to conduct the survey, please contact Sparkseeker, we are happy to organise suvey on your behalf.
