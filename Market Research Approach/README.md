# Market Research Approach

## Overview

In this section, we describe market research approaches and give some of the examples to demostrate the things we can achieve using some of those.

Typically, market research approaches are classified into primary and secondary research. Under such classification, the primary method is about dealing with people whereas the secondary approach is about dealing with data. Such classification would work in Australia. However, when we are suggesting approaches to Chinese market research, we want to add an overall third dimension to the classification which is the scale of a research target or commonly be known as Macro-Mesco-Micro level of analysis. It is due to its unique market character - diverse population, regional differences yet all strongly controlled and influenced by multiple level of government's policies and priorities.

For any foriegn product or service to succeed in China, the provider must first conducting due diligence to understand how the central government's agenda. Then at the mesco level - usually a size of large metropolitan city or a province, additional research would be necessary to understand, or even beter, leverage on the local government priorities. In China, majority of the up-to-date public accessible data source, such as the ones from the statistic bureau, only covers the macro and mesco level. Very little micro level data is available or we can cheaply sourced. So finally at the micro level, we suggest continue with the similar primary and secondary research like commonly did in Australia.

## Marco Market Research

Marco research targets the whole China market. We should pay particular attention to both the central government policy, reports and release data. If both data trend is aligned well with the policy it promotes, then it is a good sign that the government is promoting activities in certain areas.

**Secondary Research**

## Mesco Market Research

Mesco research targets either a large metropolitan city or a province.

**Primary Research**

**Secondary Research**

## Micro Research

Micro research targets consumers, channel partners or other relevant stakeholders.
