# Market Research Approach

## Overview

In this section, we describe market research approaches and give some examples to demostrate the things we can achieve using some of those.

Classic market research approaches are classified into two types: primary and secondary. Under such classification, the primary approach is more about getting insights from people whereas the secondary approach is more dealing with data. Under such classification [multiple research methods](https://github.com/SparkSeeker-AU/2-QuantitativeMarketResearch/blob/master/Market%20Research%20Approach/images/user-research-methods-3d-framework.png) can be utilised to better understand who will purchase the products / services, why they will buy and how can the provider deliver the value to the ones making the purchases in a cost-effective manner. However, when we are suggesting approaches to foreign entities aiming to do Chinese market research, we want to highlight an overall third dimension to the classification which is the scale of a research target or commonly be known as Macro-Mesco-Micro level of analysis. It is to better organise the information gathering from the complex Chinese market wich unique characters such as diverse population, big regional differences, yet at the same time, strongly controlled and influenced by multiple level of government's policies and priorities.

For any foriegn product or service to be succeeful in China, the provider must first conducting due diligence to understand the central government's agenda. Then at the mesco level - usually about a size of large metropolitan city or a province, additional research would be necessary to understand and leverage on the local government priorities. In China, majority of the up-to-date and public accessible data sources, such as the ones from the national statistic bureau, only covers the macro level and at most mesco level. Very little micro level data is available or can be cost-effectively sourced. So at the micro level, we suggest continue with consumer and local partner centric researches.

## Marco Market Research

Marco research targets the whole China market. We should start from paying particular attention to both the central government policies, reports and released data. if there is a good alignment between the policies / reports and the data trend it releases, then it will be an good indication that the government is either promoting activities in certain areas or vise versa.

**Primary Research**

The primary reserach at a Macro market level is optional. We would recommending do so for products / services under a watch list that is likely subject to existing complex local regulations or up-coming regulation changes. We will compose a watch list and share here soon.

Though central government officials can be a good interview source, they may not be easily accessible. There are other good sources for primary research at the Macro market level such as:
1. Major government sponsored think-tanks - look for strategic directions alignment or risks
2. Major domestic venture capital advisors - look for near term opportunities or risks
3. Advisors have major state owned enterprises backgrounds - look for near term opportunities or risks

**Secondary Research**

A secondary research, at least a basic check of the macro market is very much in need for the Chinese market entry.
For commodities or general categories of goods, there are import data from China customs can be purchase from Chinese data firms.

For specialiased product lines, you need to estimate using a concept called proxy. Just like the name suggests, we can use the available data related to proxy to proprotionally estimation the unknown data of the actual products or services.

Taking a product line like infant formula for 9-18 mth toddler stage for example. If you want to know how big the Chinese national market is, there is no such granular data available for the exact products. But you can find the overall product group under the China customs data with a china custom item code (HS code) - 2106909001 and Article English Name: Special infant milk powder of partial hydrolysis formular of lactoprotein, deep hydrolysis formula of lactoprotein, amino acid formular. 
Knowing that similar infant formula product is also popular on ecommerce channels, you can then search for the most similar product among websites such as taobao.com, jd.com or amazon.cn (remember to change the location to China). Track the top several sellers' sales of the exact kind of product for a short period vs. the top serverl sellers sales of the whole infant formula product range for the same period of time, you can estimate the precentage of the product sales vs product range sales. With the total import data of infant formula from the custom, you can estimate the total market size for the toddler stage product using this precentage figure.

For services, customs' category system doesn't seem to be very helpful. We usually use other proxies for estimations instead. 
We have to be creative in choosing those proxies and keeping it simple as back-of-the-envelope calculations so when additional data is available, we can revise the estimation easily and quickly.

Taking an early learning education professional who wants to provide advisory services to Chinese education providers for example, it is hard to measure the total market size using the direct research method like we did above for the toddler infant formula. Some would suggest to use the job search sites for similar positions that haven't been filled for a long period of time to estimate, but we consider it could only have limited reference value, at most as an indication of market needs, can not really serve as an estimation. It is because majority of senior positions in China do not necessarily go through the job sites, neither the job sites' advertisements status are really up-to-date and accurate. We suggest looking into three different areas for other proxies to come up with better estimations. Those three areas are:
1. Chinese local suppliers of such professional skills
2. Downstream consumers of such professional skills
3. Other factors that proved having strong correlations with the demand of such professional skills.



## Mesco Market Research

Mesco research targets either a large metropolitan city or a province.

**Primary Research**

**Secondary Research**

The secondary research at the mesco level could generally be applying filter on the macro level research data. Applying filter on a provencial level custom import data or e-commerence sales data will allow us to understand the market size at the target scale.  

## Micro Research

Micro research targets consumers, channel partners or other relevant stakeholders.
