# Market Research Approach

## Overview

In this section, we describe market research approaches (methods) and provice examples to demostrate the things we can achieve with those.

Classic market research approaches are classified into two types: primary and secondary. Under such classification, the primary approach is about getting insights from people whereas the secondary approach is dealing with data. Under such classification [multiple research methods](https://github.com/SparkSeeker-AU/2-QuantitativeMarketResearch/blob/master/Market%20Research%20Approach/images/user-research-methods-3d-framework.png) (Reference: Christian Rohrer (2018), Nielsen Norman Group.) can be utilised to better understand who will purchase the products / services, why they will buy and how can the provider delivers the value to the ones making the purchases in a cost-effective manner. However, when we are suggesting approaches to foreign entities aiming to do Chinese market research, we want to highlight an third dimension to the classification which is the scale of a research target or commonly be known as Macro-Mesco-Micro level of analysis. It is for the better organisation of the information gathered from the complex Chinese market which has unique characters such as diverse population, big regional differences, yet at the same time, strongly controlled and influenced by multiple level of government's policies and priorities.

For any foriegn product or service to be succeeful in China, the provider must first conducting due diligence to understand the central government's agenda. Then at the mesco level - usually about a size of large metropolitan city or a province, additional research would be necessary to understand and leverage on the local government priorities. In China, majority of the up-to-date and public accessible data sources, such as the ones from the national statistic bureau, only covers the macro level and at most mesco level. Very little micro level data is available or can be cost-effectively sourced. So at the micro level, we suggest continue with consumer and local partner centric researches.

## Macro Market Research

Macro research targets the whole China market. We can start from paying particular attention to both the central government policies, reports and released data. As long as there is a good correlation between the policies / reports and the data trend it releases, we can assume that the government is either promoting or restricting activities in certain sectors.

**Primary Research**

The primary reserach at a Macro market level is optional. We would recommending do so for products / services under a watch list that is likely subject to existing complex local regulations or up-coming regulation changes. We will compose a high level watch list most relevant to Australia and share out through the key-datasets soon.

Though the direct authorities can be a good primary research source, they may not be easily accessible to provide not yet published advices. We also suggest alternative good sources for primary research at the Macro market level such as:
1. Major government sponsored think-tanks - look for future strategic direction alignment or risks
2. Major domestic venture capital advisors - look for near term policy opportunities or risks
3. Advisors have major state owned enterprises backgrounds - look for near term policy opportunities or risks

**Secondary Research**

A secondary research, at least a basic check of the macro market is very much in need for Chinese market entry.
For commodities or general categories of goods, there are import data from China customs can be purchase from Chinese data firms.

For specialiased product lines, you need to estimate using a concept called proxy. Just like the name suggests, we can use the available data related to proxy to proprotionally estimation the unknown data of the actual products or services.

Taking a product line like infant formula for 9-18 mth toddler stage for example. If you want to know how big the Chinese national market is, there is no such granular data available for the exact products. But you can find the overall product group under the China customs data with a china custom item code (HS code) - 2106909001 and Article English Name: Special infant milk powder of partial hydrolysis formular of lactoprotein, deep hydrolysis formula of lactoprotein, amino acid formular. 
Knowing that similar infant formula product is also popular on ecommerce channels, you can then search for the most similar product among websites such as taobao.com, jd.com or amazon.cn (remember to change the location to China). Track the top several sellers' sales of the exact kind of product for a short period vs. the top serverl sellers sales of the whole infant formula product range for the same period of time, you can estimate the precentage of the product sales vs product range sales. Together with the total import data of infant formula from the custom, you can estimate the total market size for the toddler stage product using this precentage figure.

For services, customs' category system doesn't seem to be very helpful. We usually use other proxies for estimations instead. 
We have to be creative in choosing those proxies and keeping it simple as back-of-the-envelope calculations so when additional data is available, we can revise the estimation easily and quickly.

Taking an early learning education professional who wants to provide training and advisory services to Chinese kindergarten education providers for example, it is hard to measure the total market size using the direct research method like we did above for the toddler infant formula. Some would suggest to use the job search sites for similar positions that haven't been filled for a long period of time to estimate, but we consider it could only have limited reference value, at most as an indication of market needs, can not really serve as an estimation. It is because majority of senior positions in China do not necessarily go through the job sites, neither the job sites' advertisements status are really up-to-date and accurate. We suggest looking into the upstream and downstram of the service provider for other proxies, in order to come up with better estimations. Areas that are suitable to check inlcude:
1. Chinese local suppliers of such professional skills
2. Downstream consumer of such professional skills
3. Other factors that proves to have strong correlations with the demand of such professional skills.

With the above in mind, in our example, we can find a recent 2016 report released from China eduction bureau not only stated the total gap (estimated to reach about 3 million educators in year 2021)  between the supply of early learning education professionals and demand from Chinese kindergarten providers but also regional discrepancies. With a understanding of average size training class size, we can estimate how many trainers are required by the Chinese market. And we can then use some regional sample in our mesco market research below to further refine our market estimation. 

## Mesco Market Research

Mesco research targets either a large metropolitan city or a province.

**Primary Research**

**Secondary Research**

The secondary research at the mesco level could generally be applying filter on the macro level research data. Applying filter on a provencial level custom import data or e-commerence sales data will allow us to understand the market size at the target scale.  

## Micro Research

Micro research targets consumers, channel partners or other relevant stakeholders.
