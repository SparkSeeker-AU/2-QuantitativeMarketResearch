# Market Research Approach

## Overview

In this section, we describe market research approaches and give some of the examples to demostrate the things we can achieve using some of those.

Typically, market research approaches are classified into two types: primary and secondary. Under such classification, the primary approach is more about getting insights from people whereas the secondary approach is more about dealing with data. Such classification works well in Australia. However, when we are suggesting approaches to Chinese market research, we want to add an overall third dimension to the classification which is the scale of a research target or commonly be known as Macro-Mesco-Micro level of analysis. It is due to its unique market character - diverse population, big regional differences, yet at the same time, strongly controlled and influenced by multiple level of government's policies and priorities.

For any foriegn product or service to be succeeful in China, the provider must first conducting due diligence to understand how the central government's agenda. Then at the mesco level - usually about a size of large metropolitan city or a province, additional research would be necessary to understand, or even beter, leverage on the local government priorities. In China, majority of the up-to-date and public accessible data sources, such as the ones from the national statistic bureau, only covers the macro level and at most mesco level. Very little micro level data is available or can be cost-effectively sourced. So at the micro level, we suggest continue with end-user and local partner centric researches.

## Marco Market Research

Marco research targets the whole China market. We should start from paying particular attention to both the central government policies, reports and released data. Don't worry too much about the data accuracy at this stage. If there is a good alignment between the policies and reports it promotes and the data trend, then it is a good sign that the government is actively promoting activities in certain areas.
